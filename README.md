# Setup 

Create a [Shadertoy account](https://www.shadertoy.com/). Create a new shadertoy and copy the code from the [Humble Little Circle demo](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/7dy3RG).

# Puzzles

Do your best to replicate the following simple graphics:

1. Pulsing Flower

3. Modify the base code to create a new flower!
- Ideas: add additional shapes, create an interior for the flower, change the animation, make your flower explode, add an animated background, use color gradients.

# Submission
